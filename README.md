# Web3 + React
This project is made with [Next.js 13](https://beta.nextjs.org), and TailwindCSS. But we are going to focus on the main tools used for creating this basic interaction with the blockchain.

## DEMO
To run the app locally:
```bash
# First
yarn install

# Second
yarn dev
```

## Requirements
To start, you need to install the right packages first needed for blockchain interaction.
```bash
yarn add @web3-react/core @web3-react/injected-connector ethers web3
```
